# Css summary
## what is css?
*css stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users, how they are styled, laid out, etc.*
 
 **CSS syntax:** *The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would make the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text.
`h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`

### three ways to insert CSS:
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

**External CSS**: *Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.* 

**Internal CSS:** *The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.*

**Inline CSS:** *To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.*
