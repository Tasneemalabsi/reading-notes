# What is JavaScript ?
*JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.*
## JavaScript is a :
- prototype-based
- multi-paradigm
- single-threaded
- dynamic 
- supporting object oriented language
### standards for JavaScript:
1.  ECMAScript Language Specification
2. ECMAScript Internationalization API specification
#### JavaScript variables:
*JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.*

**In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:**

var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y;

**JavaScript Identifiers:**

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter
3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

 **JavaScript Data Types:**
- JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
- In programming, text values are called text strings.
- JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
- Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
- If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
