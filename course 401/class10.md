# Stacks and Queues
## Stacks

*A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner.*

### FILO Concept

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

### LIFO Concept

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Stack methods and operations:

- Push : adds node to the stack
- Pop: remove nodes from the stack
- Top: top node of a stack
- Peek: top node's value in a stack
- IsEmpty: returns a boolean (true: when the stack is empty)

### Stack Visual

the picture above shows the structure of a stack,the top is last node pushed into the stack and the first node that would be popped out, if it's popped out, the top of a stack will be top.next

### Stack methods and time complexity

#### Push 
pushing a node into a stack will always have a constant time complexity or O(1), because it will always take the same amount of time no matter what
#### Pop
pop also has a constant time complexity, because you will always remove from the top, there is no loops.

it's always better to check if the stack empty by using isEmpty() method before using pop, so an exception will be raised if there is no nodes to remove in 
the stack.

**Pseudo code for pop**

**ALGORITHM pop()**

`// INPUT <-- No input`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack`

`// EXCEPTION if stack is empty`

   `Node temp <-- top`
   
   `top <-- top.next`
   
   `temp.next <-- null`
   
   `return temp.value`

   ### Peek Method

peek returns the value inside the top of the stack Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. 

**Pseudo code for peek**

**ALGORITHM peek()**

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack`

`// EXCEPTION if stack is empty`

   `return top.value`

   ### isEmpty method 

   the time complexity for this method is O(1) // constant

**Pseudo code for peek**

**ALGORITHM isEmpty()**

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- boolean`

`return top = NULL`

### How can we implement a stack in Python?
*there are two ways for implementing stack in python, which are:

- Using the built-in List data structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in List data structure comes with methods to simulate both and operations.
- Using the deque library which efficiently provides stack and queue operations in one object.

## Queue

*queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first.*

### Queue concepts

**FIFO**

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

**LILO**

*This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.*

### Queue Visualization

the following picture shows the structure of a queue

![queue](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/images/Queue.PNG)

### Queue methods and operations

- Enqueue: add nodes to the queue
- Dequeue: remove nodes from a queue
- Front: first Node of the queue.
- Rear: last Node of the queue.
- Peek: the value inside the first node in a queue
- IsEmpty: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

## Enqueue and Dequeue

these two methods will always have a constant time complexity because you will always add or remove the first node .

![enqueueanddequeue](https://www.callicoder.com/static/756cf2c68e5810a2f37f27ce1ce562a8/51aac/queue-data-structure.jpg)

**ALGORITHM enqueue(value)**

`// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)`

`// OUTPUT <-- none`

   `node = new Node(value)`

   `rear.next <-- node`

   `rear <-- node`

   **ALGORITHM dequeue()**

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node`

`// EXCEPTION if queue is empty`


   `Node temp <-- front`

   `front <-- front.next`

   `temp.next <-- null`


   `return temp.value`

   ### Peek
- When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

- Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised.

- big O of time for peek is O(1) // constant

**ALGORITHM peek()**

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue`

`// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty`

   `return front.value`

### IsEmpty 
Time complexity // O(1)



**ALGORITHM isEmpty()**

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- boolean`

`return front = NULL`

### Applications of Queue Data Structure

1. When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. 
2. When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. 
3) In Operating systems:
      
4) In Networks:

       a) Queues in routers/ switches 
       b) Mail Queues
