# HTML, CSS and JavaScript
## Lists in HTML
Usually in websites, articles and papers, you will see lists to write down some instruction, notes or count things. And of course, there are easy ways to write lists in HTML, in HTML there are 3 types of lists :
1. *ordered lists : ordered lists have numbers of each item, you can create an ordered list in HTML by using the tag `<ol>` and for each item you have to use the tag `<li>`, for example :*

`<ol>`

`<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>`

`<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
 minutes until tender</li>`

`<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>`

`<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>`

`<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>`

`</ol>`

the results will be :
<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
 minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>

2. *unordered lists : unordered lists are used with bullets, there is no order in this type of lists. you can create unordered lists by using the tag `<ul>`, for example :*

`<ul>`

`<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>`

`<li>100ml milk</li>`

`<li>50g salted butter</li>`

`<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>`

`<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>`

`</ul>`

the results will be :
<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

3. *Definition Lists: The definition list is created with
the `<dl>` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions. for example :*

`<dl>`

`<dt>Sashimi</dt>`

`<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
 condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
 ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>`

`<dt>Scale</dt>`

`<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
 weight of ingredients</dd>`

`<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
 from the skin of a fish</dd>`

`<dt>Scamorze</dt>`

`<dt>Scamorzo</dt>`

`<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
 cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
 from buffalo milk)</dd>`

`</dl>`
the results will be :

<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
 condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
 ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
 weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
 from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
 cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
 from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>

**note that:**
- `<dt>`: 
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
- `<dd>`: 
This is used to contain the
definition.

*If you wanna insert a list in another one, you can use nested lists, for example:*

`<ul>`

`<li>Mousses</li>`

`<li>Pastries<li>`

 `<ul>`
 
 `<li>Croissant</li>`
 
 `<li>Mille-feuille</li>`
 
 `<li>Palmier</li>`
 
 `<li>Profiterole</li>`
 
 `</ul>`

`</li>`

`<li>Tarts</li>`

`</ul>`

**you can use abbreviations to create lists easily, for example (unordered list): `ul>li*(number of list items you want to add)`**

## Boxes in CSS
### Box dimensions (width, height)
- By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
- there are multiple ways to determine the dimensions of a box :
1.  specify the size of a box are to use pixels, this is the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size. for example:

`div.box {`

`height: 300px;`

`width: 300px;
}`

2. using percentages: in this method the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window. for example :

`p {`

`height: 75%;`

`width: 75%;
}`

3. using ems: in this method, the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it.

**Overflowing content:** The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
 1. hidden:
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
2. scroll:
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.

For example:

 `p.one {`

`overflow: hidden;}`

`p.two {`

`overflow: scroll;}`

the results will be: 

![results]()
