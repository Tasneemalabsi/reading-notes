### **how can you maintain mindset growth?** 
* *challenges*: when you face problems and hardships, you don't have to raise your hands up and suurender easily, you have to challenge yourself and keep going on.
* *effort*: you will always find it hard at the beginning, but once you start, you will feel better, it's hard to wake up in the morning, but after getting over this point you'll be fine and feel happy, hardwork always makes things better and is the key to success
* *criticism*: always know your weakness and strength points, know what your best and worst at, when are your best and worst days and ask yourself two questions:
  
  **1.What was the best part of the day?**
  
  **2.What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?**
